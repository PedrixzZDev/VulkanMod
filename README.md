This is a fabric mod that introduces a brand new **Vulkan** based voxel rendering engine to **Minecraft java** in order to both replace the default OpenGL renderer and bring performance improvements.

### Why?
- Highly experimental project that overhauls and modernizes the internal renderer for Minecraft. <br>
- Updates the renderer from OpenGL 3.2 to Vulkan 1.2 with partial 1.1 (Vulkan 1.1 compatibility with other devices is not guaranteed). <br>
- Provides a potential reference for a future-proof Vulkan codebase for Minecraft Java. <br>
- Utilizes the VulkanAPI to allow for capabilities not always possible with OpenGL. <br>
- Including reduced CPU Overhead and use of newer, modern hardware capabilities. <br>

## Known Issue with VKMod on PojavLauncher:
- Few rendering bugs with **ASR** enabled.
- Few devices doesn't support and mostly doesn't support with PowerVR GPU.

## Notes
- This mod is still in development, please report issues in the [issue tab](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/issues) with logs attached!
- This mode isn't just "minecraft on vulkan" (e.g: [zink](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html) ), it is a full rewrite of the minecraft renderer.
- This will not support 32-bit devices **(e.g. Desktops, Mobile, etc...)** but this modified version may still works on **Desktop** (not sure).
- The **modifier** has no plan to publish this publicly on **any platforms (e.g YouTube, Mediafire, etc...)**.
- This modification of **VulkanMod** is **UNOFFICIAL**.
- Use main branch **"1.20.4"** and don't worry about **Malware**, or **any viruses** because this **modified** version doesn't **APPLY** any **malicious files or codes** and trust me, I have **5 YEARS** of coding experience and I know to trace **any malicious files** at all.
- Please **DON'T report any crashes/bugs or upload** on **VulkanMod Discord** related to **PojavLauncher**.
- This is for my personal use, but you can try it for yourself **(device compatibility is not guaranteed)**.

## Others
- Probably not only mobile devices supports this modified version, also for PC/Laptop that has arm64 architecture or only supports Vulkan 1.1
